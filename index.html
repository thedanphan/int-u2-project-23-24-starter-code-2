        which is great as AI can provide an acceleration in production, ideas, and aid in improvement. However, Ai comes with a downside with the generativity, which is widely misused to create, what some may say,
        unoriginal, lifeless creations with the goal to be more efficient in resources and productive with the same quality; however, for the consumer, it really serves as a purpose as a cheated way out for some
        companies.</p>

      Ai is especially efficient in creating images, videos, and ideas relatively quickly. Although some work is involved, such as the Creator
      thinking of a promopt and inputting said prompt. Ai does most of the work, to which the creator grabs the result of the work and publishes it to either social media or the advertisement.

      "What is the point?" is what some may argue, although it may be horrible creation it will improve. However, the entirety of
      social media and advertising is about an audience and how they feel. In today's age, consumerism is lead by advertising and how the consumer feels to which
      if the consumer is not satisfied, then they will ignore it. As well, social media and advertising to some may seem like an art, which promoting these
      creators gives them a space to create and share their work. Original artwork and creation in today's age spark interest to audiences and consumers, to which
      creates a working cycle of satisfaction between the creator and the audience.
