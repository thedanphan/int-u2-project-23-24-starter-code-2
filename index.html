       <p id="Section1Text">Many see the benefit of AI in advertisements and social media, 
        which is great as AI can provide an acceleration in production, ideas, and aid in improvement. However, Ai comes with a downside with the generativity, which is widely misused to create, what some may say,
        unoriginal, lifeless creations with the goal to be more efficient in resources and productive with the same quality; however, for the consumer, it really serves as a purpose as a cheated way out for some
        companies.</p>

      <h2>Easy on the Creator, Mundane on the Audience</h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 2 below. -->
      <p id="Section2Text">
      Ai is especially efficient in creating images, videos, and ideas relatively quickly. Although some work is involved, such as the Creator
      thinking of a promopt and inputting said prompt. Ai does most of the wor, to which the creator grabs the result of the work and publishes it to either social media or the advertisement.
